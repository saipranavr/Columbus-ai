    You have been provided with detailed insights extracted from several relevant YouTube videos. These insights are below:
    --- BEGIN INSIGHTS ---
    {formatted_summaries_text}
    --- END INSIGHTS ---

    Script Requirements:
    1.  **Overall Goal:** Synthesize these insights into a coherent, engaging vlog-style script.
    2.  **Length:** Aim for a script that would be approximately 5-7 minutes of speaking time.
    3.  **Language:** English.
    4.  **Content Sections (ensure these are covered if information is available in the insights):**
        * **Catchy Introduction:** Hook the viewer and introduce "{location}".
        * **Popular Landmarks & Attractions:** Highlight key sights.
        * **Local Cuisine & Restaurants:** Showcase food experiences.
        * **Convenience Store Wisdom:** Integrate tips if available.
        * **Unique Travel Tips & Hidden Gems:** Include standout advice.
        * **Cultural Insights (if any):** Weave in cultural context.
        * **Friendly Outro:** Thank viewers.
    5.  **Grounding & Credibility:**
        * Base the script *primarily* on the provided insights.
        * **Crucially, use your Google Search capabilities to:**
            * Verify the spelling, current names, and basic factual details (e.g., "Is X still open?", "What is Y famous for?") of places, restaurants, or specific items mentioned in the summaries.
            * Add a brief, verifiable, interesting fact or up-to-date context to 1-2 key landmarks or dishes if it enhances the script and fits naturally. These facts should be confirmable via a quick search.
            * Ensure any specific claims (e.g., "best ramen") are presented as opinions from the source videos (e.g., "One vlogger raved about this being the best ramen they had...") unless widely verifiable as objective facts through your search.
    6.  **Style & Tone:**
        * Enthusiastic, friendly, authentic, and informative. Like a popular travel vlogger.
        * Include cues for visuals (e.g., "[Show footage of Kiyomizu-dera Temple]", "[Close up of delicious takoyaki]").
    7.  **Structure:** Organize with clear segments. Use conversational language.

    Do not invent information not supported by the provided summaries or your grounded verification. If a detail from a summary seems dubious or outdated after your search, omit it or cautiously qualify it.
    Provide only the complete script.
