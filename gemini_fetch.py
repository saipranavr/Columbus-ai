    Script Requirements:
    1.  **Overall Goal:** Synthesize these insights into a coherent, engaging vlog-style script.
    2.  **Length:** Aim for a script that would be approximately 5-7 minutes of speaking time.
    3.  **Language:** English.
    4.  **Content Sections (ensure these are covered if information is available in the insights):**
        *   **Catchy Introduction:** Hook the viewer and introduce "{location}".
        *   **Popular Landmarks & Attractions:** Highlight key sights from the insights.
        *   **Local Cuisine & Restaurants:** Showcase food experiences, specific dishes, or restaurant types mentioned. Emphasize any unique local recommendations.
        *   **Convenience Store Wisdom:** If there are tips about local convenience stores, integrate them.
        *   **Unique Travel Tips & Hidden Gems:** Include any standout advice or lesser-known spots from the insights.
        *   **Cultural Insights (if any):** Weave in any cultural context provided.
        *   **Friendly Outro:** Thank viewers and encourage them to visit or engage.
    5.  **Grounding & Credibility:**
        *   Base the script *primarily* on the provided insights.
        *   You may use your simulated Google Search capabilities to:
            *   Verify the spelling or current names of places mentioned in the summaries.
            *   Add a brief, verifiable, interesting fact or context to 1-2 key landmarks or dishes if it enhances the script and fits naturally.
            *   Ensure any specific claims (e.g., "best ramen") are presented as opinions from the source videos rather than absolute facts, unless widely verifiable.
    6.  **Style & Tone:**
        *   Enthusiastic, friendly, authentic, and informative.
        *   Like a popular travel vlogger.
        *   Include cues for visuals (e.g., "[Show footage of Kiyomizu-dera Temple]", "[Close up of delicious takoyaki]").
    7.  **Structure:** Organize with clear segments. Use conversational language.

    Do not invent information not supported by the provided summaries or your grounded verification.
